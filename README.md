##Dashboard Description

The dashboard is designed to provide a high-level overview of coffee sales performance, focusing on trends, product mix, geographical sales, and top customers.

Key Components:

Title and Filters:

Title: Coffee Sales Dashboard.

Filters: Located at the top, they allow users to slice the data.

Order Date: A timeline slider covering January 2019 to August 2022, allowing filtering by month and year.

Size: Filters for the size of the product sold.

Roast: Filters for the coffee roast type: Dark, Light, Medium, and (blank).

Total Sale Over Time (Line Chart):

This is the largest and most prominent chart, showing sales trends over the entire period (2019 - 2022).

It breaks down sales by coffee bean type, likely representing different product lines: Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta.

The chart highlights significant volatility and spikes, particularly in late 2021 and late 2022.

Sales By Country (Donut/Pie Chart):

This chart provides a geographical breakdown of total sales.

The primary market is the United States (79%), with the United Kingdom (1.5%) and Ireland (1%) making up smaller shares. (Note: The percentages don't add up to 100%, suggesting this chart is only showing the top few, or there are other small countries not explicitly labeled).

Top 5 Customers (Bar Chart):

This horizontal bar chart identifies the highest-spending customers.

The top five are: Terri Rains, Nealon Cuttler, Dion Fletcher, Breann Dunchedge, and Allis Wilmore.

Breann Dunchedge is clearly the highest-spending customer, with sales near 300 (units or currency).
